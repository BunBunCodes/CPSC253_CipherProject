# Overview
For my Cybersecurity class, we were tasked with creating our own cypher. I created a cypher 
that used hexadecimals and hex colour codes.

This was done after having learned about AES, RSA, and other terminology like  asymmetric
and symmetric encryption.

# Installation
The only file that you really need to download and run is 'TestingIdeas.py'
You can also download the other files if you want a pre-written message to encrypt.

# Usage
If you would like to write your own message to encrypt, then create a file called `input.txt`
After which you run the program and then choose the encryption option. Your output
will then be put into a file called `encrypted.txt`
Hex codes should also be displayed on the terminal
and come out colored in their own hex code colours.

By the way, the colours are only displayed in the terminal and in the encrypted text.

If you would like to decrypt a message that has previously been encrypted by
this cipher, then you must ensure that the file you are about to decrypt goes
by the name of `encrypted.txt`. After which the output will be placed in `output.txt`
